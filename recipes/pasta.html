      <h2>Recipe Tips</h2>
      <p>
        You can substitute unsmoked bacon or pancetta for guanciale, bucatini for spaghetti, and Parmesan cheese for Pecorino Romano if desired.
        Guanciale, dry-cured pork jowl, is available from specialty markets.
        Use Italian pasta for best results.
        Ask somebody to hold the pot so you can stir pasta quickly when pouring in egg mixture.
