      <h1>Easy Homemade Pizza Dough</h1>
      <p>
        This is a great recipe when you don't want to wait for the dough to rise.
        You just mix it and allow it to rest for 5 minutes and then it's ready to go!
        It yields a soft, chewy crust.

        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>

        <li>2 1/2 cups bread flour</li>

      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C), and lightly grease a pizza pan.</li>
        <li>Place warm water in a bowl; add yeast and sugar. Mix and let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add flour, oil, and salt to the yeast mixture; beat until smooth. You can do this by hand or use a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook to make it easier.</li>
        <li>Let rest for 5 minutes</li>
        <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll into a 12-inch circle.</li>
        <li>Transfer to the prepared pizza pan.</li>
        <li>Spread crust with sauce and toppings of your choice.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Recipe Tips</h2>
      <p>You can use all-purpose flour, but bread flour makes a superior crust. If you have a pizza stone, dust it with cornmeal and use it instead of a greased pizza pan.</p>
